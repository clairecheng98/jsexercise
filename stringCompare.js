// Create a conditional statement that checks if two strings are equal. Include an if and else statement. Create an alert() that gives feedback based on the string defined. Test your statement with different strings to make sure both alerts work.

var string_2 = "acc";
//
// var string_1 = "acc";
// var string_2 = "acc";
if (string_1==string_2){
  alert("Two strings are equal")
